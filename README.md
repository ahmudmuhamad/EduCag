# EduCag: Cache-Augmented Generation for Education

**EduCag (Educational Cache-Augmented Generation)** is a specialized AI framework designed to enhance educational question answering and content generation by leveraging a local cache of previously retrieved and processed information. Unlike traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), EduCag uses caching mechanisms to reduce redundant retrievals, improve latency, and deliver faster, more consistent responses within educational domains.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

EduCag is built to serve the needs of students, teachers, and educational platforms by combining:

- A smart caching layer for efficient reuse of past retrieved content.
- A generation layer powered by LLMs (e.g., GPT) for producing coherent, context-aware responses.
- An educational focus that ensures alignment with learning goals and academic rigor.
